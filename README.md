# Cross plot
A project for the Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) course, FMI, 2023

## Short description
The project's purpose is to draw Bezier curves in a web application through the use of de Casteljau's algorithm and create a corresponding cross plot for each curve (drawing functional curves x(t) and y(t)).
